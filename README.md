# automatic-differentiation
a minimal implementation of dual numbers and automatic differentiation.

Dual class implementation, so far, supports:
  1. native python arithmetic operations
  2. `numpy` compitability through `__array_ufunc__` decribed [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.interoperability.html#basics-interoperability)
